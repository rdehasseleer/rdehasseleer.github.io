## Ping in Ruby
Don't remember the hostname or exact IP of your second PC? Too lazy to check your router?

Use `net/ping` with `IPAddr`, for example:

```ruby
require 'ipaddr'
require 'net/ping'

network = IPAddr.new("192.168.0.0/24")
hosts = network.to_range.to_a[1..-2]

threads = []

hosts.each do |ip|
  threads << Thread.new do
    check = Net::Ping::External.new(ip.to_s)
    puts "#{ip} is up" if check.ping?
  end
end

threads.each(&:join)
```

Make sure ICMP (ping) isn't blocked on the target machines.
